# Indonesia Tax Templates (ERPNext v15+)

Use these steps to sanity-check the native PPN / PB1 tax templates and withholding tax masters generated by the migration patch.

## PPN / PB1

1. Open a **Sales Invoice** for an Indonesian company and set **Taxes and Charges** to `ID - PPN 11% Output`.
2. Submit the document and confirm a GL credit to the **Tax Payable PPN** (or reused payable) account at 11% of the net total.
3. Repeat with **Taxes and Charges** `ID - PB1 10%` to verify PB1 output uses the mapped PB1 payable account.
4. For purchase-side VAT, create a **Purchase Invoice** and pick `ID - PPN 11% Input`; verify a debit to the PPN input/prepaid tax account.

## Withholding (Non-PPh21)

1. Open a **Purchase Invoice**, tick **Apply TDS/Withholding Tax**, and choose the relevant **Tax Withholding Category** (e.g., `ID - PPh 23`).
2. Select the matching withholding tax rate (2%, 15%, 20%, 1.5%, 2.5%, 3%, 7.5%, or 10%) and submit.
3. Confirm the GL credit posts to the mapped PPh payable account (PPh 22/23/26/4(2) as applicable) and that the invoice total reflects the deduction.
